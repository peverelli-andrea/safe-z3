# Z3 UPGRADE FOR GEE & KvK

## PREFACE
I was thinking about next stellar glories and the difficulties we encountered in this one and mainly in the past one.

Fore sure if we win this we will have the governor title buff that will help us on field and can also do a good teamwork for helping the more people possible with the new mounting system btw on top of that we can also focus on the situations that can give us troubles and how to mitigate them.

There's two main scenarios that i saw giving us troubles:
- the presence of one or more kraken/good whales
- the lack of flags expecially in Hel side (even said we're working for covering way more by demolishing routes to double cities ecc)

Just take a look at our last GEE battle zones:

During GEE we have troubles containing people in Hel zone and during KvK when we want to fly castles we have troubles keeping them intact(last KvK we fly that whale only for being lucky...at least we in Hel had just a single half treb left)

## PROPOSAL
The plan is pretty simple and it's about completely fill Z3 area with flags and increase drastically the machines numbers by creating secondary alliances.

There's already one built alliance that could be ready to walk that's Ivy(subland) controlled by the second acount of DaddyRabbitz and we could create as many as we want both covering terrain for GEE and for having more machines during KvK.

We can rotate players inside those alliances for letting them grow a bit to unlock machines ecc and for making alliance funds for the flags.


An etra step could be to place one dead flag for each of them close to IC for spawn rams too on top of the trebs.

### PROS
- During KvK, when needed to defend, designated people can go inside those alliances and manage machines for overwhelming the enemy and fly krakens/whales (obv they cannot join alliance rallies but still can fight on-field)
- During GEE all Z3 area will be covered letting the enemy a KvK like spawn; we can than remove the spawn flag and fill with our castles and/or with trebs and escalades for hypotetically remove a huge part of the Z3 map from enemy spawn

### CONS
- It's a long job that require dedication from many players for let those alliance grow and come in Z3
- Less alliance rewards while in those alliance (that's why I was thinking about a players rotation)
- If we wanna cover GxE side too we have to talk with them for letting the alliance inside and moving to the areas that need to be filled
- If not well balanced the increased machinery offensive can become a less rally power due to people that went in secondary alliances

## EXTRA

Extra plans could be made for GEE.
i.e. after KvK ends we can move all the hives in a corner of the Z3 and fill all the spawn flags for forcing the opponent server march for a long time and be close for helping eachother.

Immagination is the limit than.

## MORAL OF THE STORY
During peace game limits like flags number and machinery can be bypassed with a nice teamwork :)
